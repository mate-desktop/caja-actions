      &prodname; is a &caja; extension whose principal function
      is to allow the user to add arbitrary actions to the file manager
      context menus. These actions may be organized in menus and submenus,
      exported and shared with other desktop environments.
    </para>
    <para>
      The &appname; application is the user interface which lets you precisely
      configure how, where and when your actions should appear in &caja;
      context menus, and how they will be executed.
    </para>

      &appname; provides the following features:

          </para>
          <para>
            Associated with the D-Bus interface, this program lets the user
            run any action from a keyboard shortcut, applying this action
            to the item(s) currently selected in the file manager.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A command-line program which is able to create a new action.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        All these features are more thoroughly described in the global
