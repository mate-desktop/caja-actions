        <para>
          The new action is also displayed in red color in the items
          list.
          Red color is used as an indicator that the item is invalid,
          that is that the item cannot be candidate to be displayed in
          a <productname>Caja</productname> context menu because some of its informations are
          missing or erroneous.
          Here, and though this newly inserted action has some suitable
          defaults, it lacks a command to be executed to be considered
          valid by <application>Caja-Actions Configuration Tool</application>
